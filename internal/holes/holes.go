// Package holes is the shared model + threshold policy for "holes": runs of
// consecutive segments confirmed missing from Usenet providers. One table
// governs every moment the engine meets a hole:
//
//   - at IMPORT, the fast-fail sweep classifies a file's sampled damage
//     (fail the import / import as degraded / keep checking),
//   - at HEALTH CHECK, sampled or full sweeps classify accumulated damage, and
//   - at PLAYBACK, the hole hooks decide per miss whether to zero-fill and
//     keep streaming or to kill the stream and fail the file.
//
// Ported from AIOStreams' holes.ts. This package is imported by usenet,
// importer, health and nzbfilesystem layers; it must stay dependency-free.
